        <p class="paragraph"><span style="font-family: Tahoma,Geneva, sans-serif;">Breast cancer is a disease in which cells in the breast 
        grow out of control. There are different kinds of breast cancer. The kind of breast cancer depends on which 
        cells in the breast turn into cancer.<br><br>Breast cancer can begin in different parts of the breast. A 
        breast is made up of three main parts: lobules, ducts, and connective tissue. The lobules are the glands 
        that produce milk. The ducts are tubes that carry milk to the nipple. The connective tissue (which consists 
        of fibrous and fatty tissue) surrounds and holds everything together. Most breast cancers begin in the ducts 
        or lobules.<br><br>Breast cancer can spread outside the breast through blood vessels and lymph vessels. When 
        breast cancer spreads to other parts of the body, it is said to have metastasized.</span></p>

        <div>
        <p class="paragraph"><span style="font-family: Tahoma,Geneva, sans-serif;">Doctors know that breast cancer 
        occurs when some breast cells begin to grow abnormally. These cells divide more rapidly than healthy cells 
        do and continue to accumulate, forming a lump or mass. Cells may spread (metastasize) through your breast 
        to your lymph nodes or to other parts of your body.Breast cancer most 
        often begins with cells in the milk-producing ducts (invasive ductal carcinoma). Breast cancer may also 
        begin in the glandular tissue called lobules (invasive lobular carcinoma) or in other cells or tissue 
        within the breast.<br style="box-sizing: border-box;"><br>Researchers have identified hormonal, lifestyle, 
        and environmental factors that may increase your risk of breast cancer. But it&apos;s not clear why some 
        people who have no risk factors develop cancer, yet other people with risk factors never do. It&apos;s 
        likely that breast cancer is caused by a complex interaction of your genetic makeup and your environment.
